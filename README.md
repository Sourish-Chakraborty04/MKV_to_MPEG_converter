<h1> This is a personal project made by me SOURISH CHAKARBORTY</h1><br>
This is .mkv to .mpeg converter mainly for converting movie's video files which are downloaded in .mkv format<br>
<h3> NB: I use few extensions for standard comments.</h3><br>
This is a simple gui based application made using tkinter and moviepy and tqdm which allows you to give the input file using a simple UI and the file will be stored in the same folder after a successful conversion
